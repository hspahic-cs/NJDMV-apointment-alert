# NJDMV-appoitment-alert
Want to get your driver's license? Can't get a appointment because of COVID? Well I got a solution for you. We'll get you one in 3 easy steps!

1. Monitor the site for cancelations --> My webscraper will continuously monitor the DMV site for canceled appointments and notify when one is found.
2. Fill in the form                  --> Finding canceled appoitments alone isn't fast enough. You have 20 seconds maximum before another person takes your spot. Hence auto form filler. 
3. Copy code into page console       --> We'll scrape the form, and create custom Javascript to fill in all the necessary information for you.

All YOU have to do is:
1. Choose the locations & times you're looking for in the dl-alert.py file. 
2. Run the formfill.py file once.
3. Fill in the json with your required information.
4. Run the dl-alert.py file.
5. When a spot is found, it'll automatically open the link & the txt file with the javascript code. Copy and paste that code into the dev console of the site, (ctrl + shift + I). 
6. Boom you got the appointment!

Good luck on the test! :)
